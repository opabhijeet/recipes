        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            These are the ingredients you&rsquo;ll need to make this Oatmeal Porridge: 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oats:</strong> quick-cooking oats or rolled oats </li><br>
                <li><strong>Milk:</strong> &frac12; cup milk, or as desired </li><br>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> 2 tablespoons (or as desired) raw sugar or white sugar </li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, add &frac12; cup quick-cooking oats or rolled oats in a pan.</li><br>
                <li>Add 1 cup of water.</li><br>
                <li>Then add &frac12; cup milk or as needed. You can also add more water for a dairy-free recipe.<br><br>

                <li>Add sugar as per taste. I just added 2 tablespoons raw sugar or white sugar. Sugar is completely optional. <br>
                    If adding fruits later, then you can skip sugar.<br><br>

                <li>Stir very well as you heat the oats porridge mixture on low to medium heat.</li><br>
                <li>Bring the oatmeal porridge to a gentle simmer as you continue to stir frequently.<br><br>

                <li>The porridge will thicken as it cooks. Continue to cook for a total of 5 to 6 minutes (if you have used quick cooking oats) <br>
                    or until it reaches the consistency you like. For rolled oats, cook for 10 to 12 minutes on low to medium heat. <br>
                    If the consistency is too thick for you add some more water or milk</li><br>
                <li>Turn off heat when the and the oats have softened well and you get the preferred consistency.</li><br>
                <li>Serve Oats Porridge hot or warm or at room temperature. Keep in mind that the Oatmeal Porridge will thicken as it cools.<br><br>
